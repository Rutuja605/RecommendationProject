# 📝Description
Internet is source of information as well as it is used for recreation purposes among which purchasing stuff online has become the most common thing ever. Customers or the users can buy various things from the comfort of their own homes. They don’t need to wander outside, going through numerous shops and then selecting a particular thing they want. Through E-Commerce they shop as per their liking by simply searching the name of the product they want into the search bar and buying the product which will be then delivered to their given addresses. Many a times, customers have to go through hundreds and thousands of products to get the one they like or want. They waste a considerable amount of time browsing through different products. We can reduce this time spent by using recommendation systems. Many apps and websites use this type of systems to give their customers one of its kind experiences like Netflix, Shopping apps like amazon, flipkart. These websites take into account of their customers recent buys or transactions and based on these they recommend different products to them. In the proposed system, I present a recommendation system which gives recommendation based on last transactions of the customers given in the dataset of H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendation.
